Practice folder consists of 
Some programming exercises that you can practice on your own. These cover various topics such as arithmetic operations, conditions, loops, and user input handling:
1. Sum and Average of Numbers
Problem: Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input, calculates their sum, and computes the average.
2. Multiplication Table
Problem: Write a program that generates the multiplication table of a given number up to 10.
3. Prime Number Checker
Problem: Write a program that checks if a given number is a prime number.
4. Fibonacci Sequence
Problem: Write a program that prints the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
5. Palindrome Checker
Problem: Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
6. Temperature Converter
Problem: Write a program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
7. Simple Calculator
Problem: Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.
8. Number Guessing Game
Problem: Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and lets the user guess the number, providing feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
9. Factorial Calculation
Problem: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using both for and while loops.
10. Armstrong Number Checker
Problem: Write a program that checks if a given number is an Armstrong number (a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits).
11. Reverse a Number
Problem: Write a program that takes a number as input and outputs its reverse.
12. Count Vowels and Consonants
Problem: Write a program that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels and consonants in the string.
13. Find the Largest and Smallest Number
Problem: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and finds the largest and smallest number in the list.
14. Sum of Digits
Problem: Write a program that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.
15. Check for Leap Year
Problem: Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year.
16. Print a Diamond Pattern
Problem: Write a program that prints a diamond pattern using stars (*).
17. Matrix Addition
Problem: Write a program that performs matrix addition of two 2x2 matrices.
18. Binary to Decimal Conversion
Problem: Write a program that converts a binary number (entered as a string) to its decimal equivalent.
19. Simple Interest Calculator	
Problem: Write a program that calculates simple interest based on user input for principal, rate of interest, and time.
20. Count Positive, Negative, and Zero Numbers
Problem: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and counts how many are positive, negative, and zero.

Practice set 2:
Sure! Here are the topics with numbered points:

1. **Basic Function Definition**
   - Write a method `greet` that takes a string parameter `name` and prints "Hello, name!".

2. **Function with Return Type**
   - Write a method `multiply` that takes two integer parameters and returns their product.

3. **Method Overloading**
   - Create overloaded methods `printInfo`:
     1. One that takes a string and prints it.
     2. Another that takes an integer and prints it.
     3. Another that takes a string and an integer, and prints them both.

4. **Calculations with Parameters**
   - Write a method `calculateArea` that calculates the area of a rectangle. Use method overloading to handle both integer and double parameters.

5. **Combining Multiple Methods**
   - Write a method `isEven` that takes an integer and returns true if the number is even, otherwise false.
   - Write another method `printEvenNumbers` that takes an array of integers and uses the `isEven` method to print all even numbers in the array.

6. **Overloaded Method with Different Return Types**
   - Write overloaded methods `findMax`:
     1. One that takes two integers and returns the larger one.
     2. Another that takes two doubles and returns the larger one.
     3. Another that takes three integers and returns the largest one.
