## Practice Set 1
These cover various topics such as arithmetic operations, conditions, loops, and user input handling:
### 1. Sum and Average of Numbers
**Problem**: Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input, calculates their sum, and computes the average.

### 2. Multiplication Table
**Problem**: Write a program that generates the multiplication table of a given number up to 10.

### 3. Prime Number Checker
**Problem**: Write a program that checks if a given number is a prime number.

### 4. Fibonacci Sequence
**Problem**: Write a program that prints the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

### 5. Palindrome Checker
**Problem**: Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).

### 6. Temperature Converter
**Problem**: Write a program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

### 7. Simple Calculator
**Problem**: Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.

### 8. Number Guessing Game
**Problem**: Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and lets the user guess the number, providing feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

### 9. Factorial Calculation
**Problem**: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using both for and while loops.

### 10. Armstrong Number Checker
**Problem**: Write a program that checks if a given number is an Armstrong number (a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits).

### 11. Reverse a Number
**Problem**: Write a program that takes a number as input and outputs its reverse.

### 12. Count Vowels and Consonants
**Problem**: Write a program that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels and consonants in the string.

### 13. Find the Largest and Smallest Number
**Problem**: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and finds the largest and smallest number in the list.

### 14. Sum of Digits
**Problem**: Write a program that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.

### 15. Check for Leap Year
**Problem**: Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year.

### 16. Print a Diamond Pattern
**Problem**: Write a program that prints a diamond pattern using stars (*).

### 17. Matrix Addition
**Problem**: Write a program that performs matrix addition of two 2x2 matrices.

### 18. Binary to Decimal Conversion
**Problem**: Write a program that converts a binary number (entered as a string) to its decimal equivalent.

### 19. Simple Interest Calculator
**Problem**: Write a program that calculates simple interest based on user input for principal, rate of interest, and time.

### 20. Count Positive, Negative, and Zero Numbers
**Problem**: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and counts how many are positive, negative, and zero.

## Practice Set 2
The below cover defining and using methods in Java, including function parameters, return types, method overloading, and combining methods for practical problem-solving
### 1. Basic Function Definition
**Task**: Write a method `greet` that takes a string parameter `name` and prints "Hello, name!".

### 2. Function with Return Type
**Task**: Write a method `multiply` that takes two integer parameters and returns their product.

### 3. Method Overloading
**Task**: Create overloaded methods `printInfo`:
  - One that takes a string and prints it.
  - Another that takes an integer and prints it.
  - Another that takes a string and an integer, and prints them both.

### 4. Calculations with Parameters
**Task**: Write a method `calculateArea` that calculates the area of a rectangle. Use method overloading to handle both integer and double parameters.

### 5. Combining Multiple Methods
**Task**: 
  - Write a method `isEven` that takes an integer and returns true if the number is even, otherwise false.
  - Write another method `printEvenNumbers` that takes an array of integers and uses the `isEven` method to print all even numbers in the array.

### 6. Overloaded Method with Different Return Types
**Task**: Write overloaded methods `findMax`:
  - One that takes two integers and returns the larger one.
  - Another that takes two doubles and returns the larger one.
  - Another that takes three integers and returns the largest one.

This structure should help you organize and tackle the practice problems efficiently.
