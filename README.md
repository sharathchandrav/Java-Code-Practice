7. Simple Calculator
Problem: Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.
8. Number Guessing Game
Problem: Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and lets the user guess the number, providing feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
9. Factorial Calculation
Problem: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using both for and while loops.
10. Armstrong Number Checker
Problem: Write a program that checks if a given number is an Armstrong number (a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits).
11. Reverse a Number
Problem: Write a program that takes a number as input and outputs its reverse.
12. Count Vowels and Consonants
